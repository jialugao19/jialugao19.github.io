"Financial crises are everywhere and always due to problems of short-term debt. "

<!--more-->

## Introduction

> Doug Diamond: “Financial crises are everywhere and always due to problems of short-term debt (and to the reasons why short-term debt is needed).”

### Definition of Financial Crisis

- Definition 1: Caprio & Klingbiel (1996)

> A “systemic banking crisis” occurs when “most or all of the capital in the banking system has been exhausted”.

This definition is Useful for going to the data in the modern (post-1970) era, but hard to use pre-1970, because it is subjective to value assets in more complex environments.

- Definition 2: Laevan and Valencia (2012)

> A systemic banking crisis occurs when there are:
>
> - Significant signs of financial **distress** in the banking system (as indicated by significant bank runs, losses in the banking system, and/or bank liquidations);
> - Significant banking policy **intervention** measures in response to significant losses in the banking system.

- Definition 3: Reinhart & Rogoff

Financial crises are
> Bank runs that lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial institutions;
> If there are no runs, then the closure, merging, takeover, or large-scale government assistance of an important financial institution (or group of institutions), that marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial institutions.

- Definition 4: Gorton (2012)

> A financial crisis is an event where holders of short-term debt issued by financial intermediaries withdraw en masse or refuse to renew their loans – or would have engaged in such a mass run had not explicit or implicit government intervention been in place or been expected.

These definitions reveal a paradox in economy: **there is need for short-term debt; but short-term debt is fragile.**

### Characteristics of Crises

- **Crises are Systemic**.

“Systemic” means the solvency of the entire financial system is threatened. A crisis is not just a bad event, like the crash of the tech bubble.

Gouge (1837; italics in original):
> "At the present moment [during the Panic of 1837], all the Banks in the United States are bankrupt; and, not only they, but all the Insurance Companies, all the Railroad Companies, all the Canal Companies, all the City Governments, all the Country Governments, all the State Governments, the General Government, and a great number of people. This is literally true. The only legal tender is gold and silver. Whoever cannot pay, on demand, in the authorized coin of the country, a debt actually due, is, in point of fact, bankrupt: although he may be at the very moment in possession of immense wealth, and although, on the winding up of his affairs, he may be shown to be worth millions."

Geithner:
> “Of the twenty-five largest financial institutions at the start of 2008, thirteen failed (Lehman, WaMu), received government help to avoid failure (Fannie, Freddie, AIG, Citi, BofA), merged to avoid failure (Countryside, Bear, Merrill, Wachovia), or transformed their business structure to avoid failure (Morgan Stanley, Goldman)”.

Bernanke’s FCIC testimony--During September and October 2008:
> “... of the 13 the most important financial institutions in the United States, 12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two”.

- **Financial Crises are Not Rare**

Financial crises have occurred in all market economies throughout history; occur in advanced economies; occur in emerging markets; occur with and without deposit insurance; occur in economies with or without central banks; occur with different forms of bank debt.

Since 1970 there have been 147 systemic events around the world. Of the 147 events, about 65% involved bank runs.

### Costs of Crises

- Reinhart & Rogoff:

> **Real per capita GDP** growth rates are significantly lower during the decade following these episodes compared to the decade prior to the crisis.

> **Unemployment rates** in the decade after these crises, are significantly higher than in the decade preceding the crisis.

- van Dijk (2013)

van Dijk studies 187 banking crises in 126 countries over the period 1970-2009 and looks crisis impact on health, education, poverty, gender issues.

On average sample countries face 1.5 crises and are in a crisis
in five out of forty years.

- Funke, Schularitz, and Trebesch (2015)
Funke et al. study the **political fallout** from financial crises in 20 advanced economies over 140 years.

After a crisis, voters attracted to political rhetoric of the extreme right. Far right parties increase their vote chare by 30%. Financial recessions predict far-right vote shares. Street protests, riots, and strikes dramatically increase.

### It Has Been Hard to Understand Crises

Lucas:
> “The Great Depression ... remains a formidable barrier to a completely unbending application of the view that business cycles are all alike.”
> “The magnitude of the Great Depression dealt a serious blow to the idea of the ‘same’ event. . . The Depression continues, in some respects, to defy explanation by existing economic analysis.”(“Methods and Problems in Bus. Cycle Research”)
> “There is no real business cycle model that can map these [GD] shocks into anything like the 40% decline in real output and employment that occurred between 1929 and 1933 (nor, indeed, does anyone claim that there is).

Prescott (1983):
> “How can a theory claim to explain the business cycle if it cannot explain the Great Depression?”
> “... competitive equilibrium theory is not suited to modelingeconomic fluctuations in periods of great political and financial institution instability.” (1983)
> “Can the Cycle be Reconciled…”

Boyd, De Nicolò, Loukoianova (2010):
> Modern dating of financial crises is based on the “events method”, that is a crisis is said to start when there is observed govt./central bank responses. By then something is already happening.
> There is a lot of disagreement among researchers in dating the same modern crises.
> Bank lending that is lower than 25th percentile of the entire distribution of real domestic lending predicts the crisis start dates in the four big crisis data sets! But a similar measure of a decline in demand deposits does not predict the start dates!
> The probability of a financial crisis is unaffected by the presence or absence of deposit insurance.

## Financial Intermediaries

### Definition of bank

Doug Diamond:
> “Financial crises are everywhere and always due to problems of short-term debt (and to the reasons why short-term debt is needed).”

Ricardo (1876, p. 409):
> "In the use of money, everyone is a trader; those whose habits and pursuits are little suited to explore the mechanism of trade are obliged to make use of money, and are no way qualified to ascertain the solidity of different banks whose paper is in circulation; accordingly we find that men living on limited incomes, women, laborers, and mechanics of all descriptions, are often severe sufferers by the failure of country banks..."

### Diamond and Dybvig JPE 1983 (Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity)

Model Set-up

- 3 dates: $t=0, 1, 2$.
- Single storable good.
- Endowments: $1$ unit each at $t=0$.
- Production: $1$ in $t=1$ or $R$ in $t=2$.
- Agents: two types ($\theta=1,2$). Suppose that type is public information. But agents privately learn their type at t=1.
- $\theta=1$: prob $\lambda: V(c_1,c_2)=u(c_1)$, “early consumer”, agent salvages investment and eats: $c_1^1 = 1$ (superscript is type; sub is time).
- $\theta=2$: prob $1-\lambda: V(c_1,c_2)=\beta u(c_1 + c_2)$, “late consumer”, agent can consume at $t=1$ or $t=2$. Choose $c_1^2, c_2^2$ to

$$\max \beta u(c_1^2 + c_2^2),$$

$$c_2^2 = R(1-c_1^2), c_1^2, c_2^2 \geq 0. $$

- Also, there is a bank. Optimal contract that the bank offers depositors is:

$$\max \lambda u(c_1^1) + (1-\lambda)\beta u(c_1^2 + c_2^2),$$

$$(1-\lambda)c_2^2 = R [1-(\lambda c_1^1 + (1-\lambda)c_1^2)], c_t^j \geq 0 $$

Optimal Contract

- Prop: Suppose $R>\frac 1\beta >1$ and $\sigma \geq 1$ (RA parameter). Then: $1<c_1^1<c_2^2<R$.
- Bank can offer deposit rates: $r_1 = c_1^1$ and $r_2 = c_2^2$.

Bank Runs: There can be a problem if type is private information.

- Suppose late consumers can choose an action “withdraw” or “not withdraw”: $a \in \{W, NW \} $ and the payoff is $V(a, a_{-1}) $ to a consumer who chooses $a$ when others choose $a_{-1}$.
- The contract is vulnerable to a run if:

$$V(W, W)>V(N,W) and V(N, N) > V(W, N)$$

Final Points

- **Bank may not be optimal**. Don’t know prob of a run. Postlewaite and Vives JPE
• In original paper run with sunspots there are
no testable implications. Goldstein and
Pauzner JF “fix” this with global games.
• Panic is the very thing we are trying to
explain—how confidence is lost. Here
sunspots.
